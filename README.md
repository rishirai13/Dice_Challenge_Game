## ✨ Overview

The **Dice Challenge Game** is a simple, interactive web app built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.  
Each time you refresh the page, two dice roll automatically — generating random values between 1 and 6 — and the winner is declared instantly.  
It’s a fun and beginner-friendly project illustrating random number generation, DOM manipulation, and dynamic UI updates.
